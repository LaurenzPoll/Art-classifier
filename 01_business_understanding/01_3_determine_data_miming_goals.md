# 3. Determine Data Mining Goals

## 3.1. Technical Objectives

- **Train a model** (CNN) to embed or classify artworks by style, artist, or period using images and/or metadata.
- **Implement an NLP pipeline** to leverage textual metadata for grouping or retrieval tasks.

## 3.2. Data Requirements

- **Images:** Sufficient quality and variety in the toy dataset for prototyping.
- **Labels/Metadata:** Must include art style, artist, and other relevant information for supervised and NLP tasks.

## 3.3. Success Measures

- **Grouping/classification accuracy** >70% for main curation task (style/art movement).
- **Prototype** demonstrates both image-based and metadata/NLP-based curation.
